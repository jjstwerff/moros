# LOFT_HANDOFF.md — findings for the loft side, ready to file

## Context

Found **2026-07-22** on toolchain **2026.7.2** (`/usr/local/bin/loft`), while recovering the
`moros_*` packages ([moros#2](https://github.com/jjstwerff/moros/issues/2)). The package test
suites are unaffected — **435 tests green across five packages, zero warnings**. Everything
below fails only when a program actually *runs*: the same code compiles clean and its unit
tests pass.

That split is the useful signal. `loft test` exercises these libraries thoroughly and stays
green; the moment a `fn main()` builds a scene and writes a file, the store layer falls over.

## H1 — `graphics::sphere()` panics at runtime, with a different index every run

**Status:** not filed · **Repo:** `loft-lang/loft` (or `loft-libs-graphics`)
**Severity:** high — the published `graphics` 0.5.0 package, one call, no consumer code
**Suggested title:** `runtime: graphics::sphere() panics in database/allocation.rs with a non-deterministic out-of-bounds index`

### Minimal reproducer

Four lines, no Moros sources, no `--lib` flags. Only the registry package:

```loft
#cwd
use graphics;

fn main() { m = sphere("s", 1.0, 3, 3); println("ok verts={len(m.vertices)}"); }
```

```sh
loft --interpret --path <loft-checkout>/ c.loft
```

### What happens

```
  at …/c.loft:3:27

thread 'main' panicked at src/database/allocation.rs:919:29:
index out of bounds: the len is 4 but the index is 53216
```

### The two facts worth acting on

1. **The index is different every run** — 42784, 32176, 20768, 47360, 53216 across five
   invocations of the *same* binary on the *same* file. A deterministic off-by-one would not
   move. This reads as a garbage/uninitialised value being used as an index, not an
   arithmetic mistake.
2. **`--check` passes cleanly** (`loft --interpret --check … c.loft` → `ok`), so this is a
   runtime store fault, not codegen or lifetime analysis.

### Controls already run

- `mesh("x")` alone — **no panic**. Only the `sphere` builder trips it.
- `canvas(4, 4)` alone — **no panic**.
- Smaller sphere (`3, 3` segments instead of `8, 8`) — **still panics**, so it is not a size
  or capacity threshold.

## H2 — three consumer-level crashes, three different symptoms, one suspected root

**Status:** not filed · **Repo:** `loft-lang/loft`
**Severity:** high — blocks the GLB export path entirely
**Suggested title:** `runtime: store-lifetime faults on program exit / const init (3 reproducers, one consumer)`

All three are `moros_render` examples. All three fail **identically at every commit in the
recovery series, including `c173629`, the verbatim restore of code written a year earlier** —
so no edit of ours introduced them. Caches cleared (`native-auto/`, `.loft/`) and the native
artifact regenerated between runs; no change.

Run from a Moros checkout:

```sh
loft --interpret --path <loft-checkout>/ --lib lib/ \
     lib/moros_render/examples/<example>.loft <out.glb>
```

| example | symptom |
|---|---|
| `demo_village` | `loft: BUG (#306): refused to free the stack store (#0) (rec=0, pos=0, var='') — a stack-record ref was treated as an owned heap store`, then `2 stores not freed at program exit`. **No output file written.** The scene builds — it prints `total vertices: 7796 / total triangles: 6448` — and dies on the way out |
| `isolated_stair` | **core dump**, reported at `moros_render.loft:1365:39`, which is a `mesh_aabb(…)` call |
| `moros_glb` | `thread 'main' panicked at src/store.rs:1774:9: Write to read-only store at rec=1 fld=0 (locked by: compile.rs::compile (CONST_STORE init))` — and this one fires **before the input file is read**: it panics identically with `/definitely/missing.json` as the input, where the expected behaviour is a "no such file" error |

### Why one root cause is suspected

Every symptom lands in the store layer — a stack record treated as a heap store, an
out-of-bounds store index, a write to a const-initialised store. H1 is the same
neighbourhood (`database/allocation.rs`) reached from a four-line program, so it is plausibly
the smallest expression of whatever these three hit. **That is a hypothesis, not a claim** —
we have not read the runtime.

### What this costs the consumer

The GLB exporter is the only route Moros has to *look* at generated geometry, so a change to
the renderer currently cannot be verified visually — only through unit tests. This is why the
corner-order reconciliation ([moros#3](https://github.com/jjstwerff/moros/issues/3)) was
pinned with a numeric test rather than a rendered comparison.

## H3 — the crash location for H1 pointed at unrelated source

**Status:** not filed · **Severity:** low — a diagnostics-quality issue, but it cost time
**Suggested title:** `diagnostics: runtime fault location points at an unrelated function`

An earlier form of the H1 reproducer (sphere + scene + `save_scene_glb`) reported:

```
loft: BUG (#306): … at /home/…/registry/graphics-0.5.0/src/graphics.loft:1398:26
```

Line 1398 of `graphics.loft` is inside an **`sfx_*` audio helper** — a noise-buffer
comprehension that the program never calls. The reduced reproducer points at the real call
site, so the location is wrong specifically in the failing case. A misattributed location
sends a reader to the wrong subsystem, which is the expensive kind of wrong.
